Portofolio Computational Musicology
I examined two playlists of mine that I use for different occasions, a party playlist and a mellow playlist. The party playlist mainly contains commercial hiphop but occasionally also some famous pop songs by artist such as Bruno Mars and Beyonce. The mellow playlist however, is more of an amalgam of genres as it contains jazz, hiphop, neo-soul and indie.
The sonice differences between the two playlist are obvious however I wondered whether Spotify would think the same. The first analyses I made was based on the total average danceability of each playlist. Rather unexpectedly, the differenece was not huge, with a danceabilty ratio of 0.608 and 0.788 for the mellow and party playlist, respectively.
Secondly, I wanted see whether the difference was due to the tempo of the tracks. I computed the average tempo of each playlist through the summarize and mean functions. With a tempo of 122BPM, the party playlist surpasses the 105 BPM of the mellow playlist. This difference seemed more noticieable than the danceability ratio, thus it seems that there are multiple factors which influence danceabilty besides tempo.

I did not manage to do this yet but I would like to compare the two playlists based on mode. I wonder whether the mellow playlist contains a higher amount of minor songs compared to the party playlist.

I would like to make a graph which illustrates the amount of times the minor and major modes is used in each playlist. I did not manage to do this as I struggled with merging the information of playlists.
