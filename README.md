Portofolio Computational Musicology
I examined two playlists of mine that I use for different occasions, a party playlist and a mellow playlist. The party playlist mainly contains commercial hiphop but occasionally also some famous pop songs by artist such as Bruno Mars and Beyonce. The mellow playlist however, is more of an amalgam of genres as it contains jazz, hiphop, neo-soul 
The sonice differences between the two playlist are obvious however I wondered whether Spotify would think the same. The first analyses I made was based on the total average danceability of each playlist. Rather unexpectedly, the differenece was not huge, with a danceabilty ratio of 0.608 and 0.788 for the mellow and party playlist, respectively.
Secondly, I wanted see whether the difference was due to the tempo of the tracks. I computed the average tempo of each playlist through the summarize and mean functions. With a tempo of 122BPM, the party playlist 

The tempo difference betweent the playlist was more noticeable


Compare them on danceability and on pitch 
Mellow contains 144 songs and Party 166 songs.
